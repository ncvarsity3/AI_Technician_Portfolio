Examples of Python Code
The folders within this portfolio contain some of the projects I have worked on in the past 4 months for review.

**Snake**

This is my effort at making the classic snake game using the turtle library and object-oriented programming using Visual Studio Code. Using the Up/Down/Left/Right keys, the snake moves in the direction of the arrow you push. When the snake touches the food, the food moves to a different position on the board and the scoreboard keeps count of the times the food's been "eaten" by the snake. The program also maintains the historical high score for the overall game by storing the integer within the "data.txt" file.   

**guess_the_state**   *MUST HAVE PANDAS INSTALLED TO USE*

This state guessing game was made using the turtle and pandas libraries and object-oriented programming using PyCharm IDE. As the user guesses the 50 states, the pop-up keeps score on the number of states correctly guessed. When the user types "exit" into the guess bar, the program creates a "states_to_learn.csv" file that lists all of the states that were not guessed.

**password-manager**  *MUST INSTALL PYPERCLIP TO WORK*

This program was developed using PyCharm IDE. It uses Tkinter to create a GUI that lets a user input a website, plus a corresponding email and password for safe keeping. The GUI provides an option for the user to create a randomly generated password. The program uses JSON to store and search for passwords within the "data.json" file.

**pomodoro**

This program was developed using PyCharm IDE. It uses Tkinter to create a GUI that visually displays the Pomodoro Technique for time management.
